### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a site for a tech charity in Seattle that is just getting up off the ground. This charity wants to help make technology easier to obtain for those in need, especially kids to be able to keep up with school in these times. The site will be built in pure HTML and CSS, and I will post a link once it's live.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Nest.js to use as my backend. I have already gotten a decent enough grasp of Nuxt.js for the front-side.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what drew me to coding in the first place!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: stop by my website: www.jimstrother.com ***OR*** by email-- jim.strother@gmail.com ***OR*** on Twitter-- @Jim_Codes_JS

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (and all I care about you is how decent of a person you are. Content of the character and all that, you know?)
