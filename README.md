### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Currently building an app to help beer-lovers find local breweries & brew pubs! Great for finding new brews near where you live or while traveling! Remember! Always Drink Local! ðŸ˜„

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Nest.js to use as my backend. I have already gotten a decent enough grasp of Nuxt.js for the front-side.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what drew me to coding in the first place!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: stop by my website: www.jimstrother.com ***OR*** by email-- jim.strother@gmail.com ***OR*** on Twitter-- @Jim_Codes_JS

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (and all I care about you is how decent of a person you are. Content of the character and all that, you know?)

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a coding position with a small- to medium-sized company. Yes, the company's mission is important to me. The higher the good, the better.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm having a love affair with soccer, and my wife is ok with that.
