## Hey! What's up? How's it going?

- I'm very interested in Bun vs Node. I really like the idea of having the majority of my dev tools being in one place and not having to spend hours setting up everything.

- I really love working with SvelteKit.

- I have recently become fascinated with Rust and am learning as much as I can as fast as I can to do the amazing things it offers!

- I have a full beard now instead of the goatee in the picture. Don't worry, I keep it nice and neatly trimmed!

- Pronouns: He/Him/His

- Fun fact: I'm having a love affair with soccer, and my wife is ok with that.
