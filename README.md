### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Currently building out a portfolio site for an illustrator to display his artwork. Built in Svelte and Tailwind. (Yeah, he's a friend of mine also. Always happy to help him out!) ðŸ˜„

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Nest.js to use as my backend. I have already gotten a decent enough grasp of Nuxt.js for the front-side. Although, I am in the process of pivoting to Svelte for my front-end, and am eagerly awaiting SvelteKit to hit 1.0!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what drew me to coding in the first place!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: stop by my website: [jimstrother.com](http://jimstrother.com) ***OR*** by email-- jim.strother@gmail.com ***OR*** on Twitter-- [@Jim_Codes_JS](https://twitter.com/Jim_Codes_JS)

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a coding position with a small- to medium-sized company. Yes, the company's mission is important to me. The higher the good, the better.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm having a love affair with soccer, and my wife is ok with that.
