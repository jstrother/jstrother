### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a soccer-football prediction game. The player tries to guess the outcome of seven randomly chosen European soccer matches. I had temporarily paused coding because my wife and I moved from Seattle to St. Paul, MN. Oh, and there was this pandemic thing that interfered with real-life soccer. I will be getting back on this very soon.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Nest.js to use as my backends. I have already gotten a decent enough grasp of Nuxt.js for the front-side.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what drew me to coding in the first place!

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: by email-- jim.strother@gmail.com ***OR*** on Twitter-- @Jim_Codes_JS

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (and all I care about you is how decent of a person you are. Content of the character and all that, you know?)
