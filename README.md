## Hey! What's up? How's it going?

- I'm very interested in Bun vs Node. I really like the idea of having the majority of my dev tools being in one place and not having to spend hours setting up everything.

- I really love working with SvelteKit, but have also recently discovered Astro. Both have different use cases, and I am interested in discovering where one would be more beneficial than the other.

- Being a geek, the era of AI and Machine Learning that we are in has led to my interest in Python and Rust. I am very curious as to how I can leverage these languages to increase my understanding of AI and ML.

- I have a full beard now instead of the goatee in the picture. Don't worry, I keep it nice and neatly trimmed!

- Pronouns: He/Him/His

- Fun fact: I'm having a love affair with soccer, and my wife is ok with that.
